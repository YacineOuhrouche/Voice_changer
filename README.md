The Real-Time Voice Changer extension is a Chrome extension designed to alter the pitch, tone, and effects of a user's voice during virtual meetings. By integrating with popular video conferencing platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams, the extension allows users to modify their voice in real-time for more engaging or fun interactions. Users can adjust the voice settings to anonymize themselves, add humorous effects, or simply enhance the clarity of their voice.
